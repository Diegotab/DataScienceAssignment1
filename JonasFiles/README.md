# Data Science Assignment 1: LifeCycleSavings

The folder contains descriptive analysis - measures of central tendency as well as measures of dispersion - of the LifeCycleSavings R dataset. Furthermore, it will be looked into correlations between different variables.

# Description of dataset and variables of interest

The LifeCycleSavings dataset is a data frame containing information on the savings ratio between 1960 and 1970 over 50 countries. It includes the following 5 variables (taken from R):
- sr:     aggregate personal savings
- pop15:  % of population under 15
- pop75:  %  of population over 75
- dpi:    real per-capital disposable income
- ddpi:   % growth rate of dpi.

Thus, the dataset includes demographic as well as economic variables (potential explanatory variables for the savings ratio)

# Guide to R code

The R code in this folder conducts a number of descriptive statistics, namely measures of central tendency and measures of dispersion. Furthermore, correlations between variables were analyzed as a first step to identify potential explanatory variables (per-capita GDP; per-capita GDP growth; demographic factors) for the aggregated personal savings.

Measures of central tendency: histograms, mean, median

Measures of dispersion: standard deviation, range, interquartile range, boxplots

Correlations: plots; significance tests
